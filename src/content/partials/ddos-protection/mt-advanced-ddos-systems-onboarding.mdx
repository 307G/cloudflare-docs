[Magic Transit](/magic-transit/) customers are automatically onboarded to the Advanced TCP Protection and Advanced DNS Protection systems. 

Every 10 minutes, the `flowtrackd` API will look for new accounts in the conduit API. For each new account that it finds, it will add the account and its `authorized_prefixes` to the `flowtrackd` API, add default manual thresholds and rules for the TCP policer, TCP tracker, and DNS trackerâ€”all in `monitoring` mode, and set the protection status to `Enabled` which allows `flowtrackd` to start processing your traffic.

:::note
If the `flowtrackd` API cannot find any `authorized_prefixes` for an account in the conduit API, it will wait to onboard you until the prefixes are present (up to seven days).
