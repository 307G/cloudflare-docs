When you set up auto-moves in Section 5,  you can move messages manually or set up automatic moves to send messages matching certain dispositions to specific folders within a userâ€™s mailbox. 

You can also enable Post Delivery Response and Phish Submission Response to re-evaluate messages previously delivered against new information gathered by Email Security. Scanned emails that were previously delivered and now match this new phishing information will be moved.

Refer to the Office 365 guide in section 5 for detailed information.
