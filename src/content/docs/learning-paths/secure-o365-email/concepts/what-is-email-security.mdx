Email security is the process of preventing [email-based](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email/) cyber attacks and unwanted communications. 

It spans protecting inboxes from takeover, protecting domains from spoofing, stopping phishing attacks, preventing fraud, blocking malware delivery, filtering spam, and using encryption to protect the contents of emails from unauthorized persons.

Security and privacy were not built into email when it was first invented, and despite email's importance as a communication method, these are still not built into email by default. As a result, email is a major attack vector for large and small organizations, and for individuals well.
