Email security is the process of preventing email-based cyber attacks and unwanted communications. 

It spans protecting inboxes from takeover, protecting domains from spoofing, stopping phishing attacks, preventing fraud, blocking malware delivery, filtering spam, and using encryption to protect the contents of emails from unauthorized persons.

Security and privacy were not built into email when it was first invented. Despite email's importance as a communication method, security and privacy are still not built into email by default. As a result, email is a major attack vector for large and small organizations, and for individuals well.
