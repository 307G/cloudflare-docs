Email security is the process of preventing [email](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email/)-based cyber attacks and unwanted communications. It spans protecting inboxes from takeover, protecting domains from [spoofing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-domain-spoofing/), stopping [phishing attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/phishing-attack/), preventing fraud, blocking [malware](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/malware/) delivery, filtering [spam](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/how-to-stop-spam-emails/), and using [encryption](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-encryption/) to protect the contents of emails from unauthorized persons.*

Security and [privacy](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-data-privacy/) were not built into email when it was first invented, and despite email's importance as a communication method, these are still not built into email by default. As a result, email is a major [attack vector](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/attack-vector/) for large and small organizations, and for individuals well.*
