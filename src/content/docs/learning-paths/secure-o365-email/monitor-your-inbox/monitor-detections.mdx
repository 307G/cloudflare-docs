Spam and Malicious emails are blocked outright by Email Security, but suspicious and spoof dispositions should be monitored. Suspicious messages should be investigated by a security analyst to determine the legitimacy of the message. 

[PhishGuard](/cloudflare-one/email-security/phish-guard/), Cloudflare's managed email security service can review these messages for you and move them from the end user inbox if they are deemed malicious. 

Messages that receive a Spoof disposition should be investigated as well because it signals that the traffic is either non-compliant with your email authentication process [SPF](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/), [DKIM](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/), [DMARC](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dmarc-record/), or has a mismatching Envelope From and Header From value.  

In most cases, this disposition is triggered by a legitimate third-party mail service. If you determine that the Spoofed email is a legitimate business use case, you can either:

- Update your email authentication records.
- Add an acceptable sender [allow policy](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/allow-policies/) to exempt messages from the Spam, Spoof or Bulk disposition, but not Malicious or Suspicious, so the content of the message can still be monitored.
