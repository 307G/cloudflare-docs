Email Security can be deployed quickly. Setting up the Graph API only takes a few minutes. 

Email Security uses machine learning techniques to better understand your email environment. For this reason, there is a 5-7 day baseline period in which False Negative and False Positives are to be expected while the system learns what your normal mail patterns are. 

Moving from a cold start straight into production is not recommended. 

You can use the following testing methods which provide visibility during the baseline period without disruption to mail flow:
