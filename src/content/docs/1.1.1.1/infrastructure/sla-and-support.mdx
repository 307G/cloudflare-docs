As you use 1.1.1.1 in your infrastructure, note that dedicated technical support is limited.

If you need service level agreements (SLAs) and dedicated support, consider using [Cloudflare Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/) instead.

Gateway includes other advanced options such as domain categories, customized filtering, and scheduling capabilities. For example, if you are a device manufacturer or network operator, you can use a multi-tenant environment to allow your customers to configure their own individual filters.
