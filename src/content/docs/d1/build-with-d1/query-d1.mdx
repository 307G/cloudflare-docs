There are three primary ways you can query a D1 database:

1. Using [D1 Workers Binding API](/d1/worker-api/) in your code.
2. Using [D1 REST API](/api/operations/cloudflare-d1-create-database).
3. Using [D1 Wrangler commands](/d1/wrangler-commands/).

## Query D1 with Workers Binding API

Workers Binding API primarily interacts with the data plane, and allows you to query your D1 database from your Worker.

This requires you to:

1. Bind your D1 database to your Worker.
2. Prepare a statement.
3. Run the statement.

Refer to [Workers Binding API](/d1/worker-api/) for more information.

## Query D1 with REST API

REST API primarily interacts with the control plane, and allows you to create/manage your D1 database.

You can either use the REST API directly, or use Wrangler commands, which calls the REST API to perform its functions.

- Refer to [D1 REST API](/api/operations/cloudflare-d1-create-database) for D1 REST API documentation.
- Refer to [D1 Wrangler commands](/d1/rest-api/wrangler-commands/) for the full list of D1 Wrangler commands.

## Query D1 with SQL API

D1 is compatible with most SQLite's SQL convention since it leverages SQLite's query engine.

- Refer to [D1 SQL API](/d1/sql-api/sql-statements/) to learn more about supported SQL queries.
